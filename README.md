# Computer-Vision
Fine-tuning, Object detection tasks completed during computer vision internship at Netra AI.
The Overall task is to learn concepts, fine-tune the models and deploy locally using flask.

Download anyone of above folder and run the app.py file. 
Make sure you have installed flask and other required python dependancies.
