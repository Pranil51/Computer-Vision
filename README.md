# Computer-Vision
Fine-tuning, Object detection tasks completed during computer vision internship at Netra AI.
The Overall task is to learn concepts, fine-tune the models and deploy locally using flask.

Download anyone of above folder and run the app.py file. 
Make sure you have installed flask and other required python dependancies.

1. TF2_detection -  fine tuned tensorflow model  on custom pedestrains labelled data.
    detects- Person/pedestrains
    trained on colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mugrhVOJ9zQdFhDkZpaW77agWDyo_YJy?usp=sharing
